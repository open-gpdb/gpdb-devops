# Script: parse_results.pl
# Description: Processes Greenplum test output to extract statistics
# and results.
#             Analyzes test log files to determine:
#             1. Overall test status (pass/fail)
#             2. Total number of tests run
#             3. Number of passed, failed, and ignored tests
#             4. Names of failed and ignored tests
#             5. Validates test counts for consistency
#             Results are written to a file for shell script processing.
#
# Arguments:
#   log-file    Path to test log file (required)
#
# Input File Format:
#   Expects test log files containing one of the following summary formats:
#   - "All X tests passed."
#   - "Y of X tests failed."
#   - "X of Y tests passed, Z failed test(s) ignored."
#   - "X of Y tests failed, Z of these failures ignored."
#
#   And failed or ignored test entries in format:
#   - "test_name ... FAILED"
#   - "test_name ... failed (ignored)"
#
# Output File (test_results.txt):
#   Environment variable format:
#   STATUS=passed|failed
#   TOTAL_TESTS=<number>
#   FAILED_TESTS=<number>
#   PASSED_TESTS=<number>
#   IGNORED_TESTS=<number>
#   FAILED_TEST_NAMES=<comma-separated-list>
#   IGNORED_TEST_NAMES=<comma-separated-list>
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Read access to input log file
#   - Write access to current directory
#   - Perl 5.x or higher
#
# Exit Codes:
#   0 - All tests passed, or only ignored failures occurred
#   1 - Some non-ignored tests failed
#   2 - Parse error or cannot access files
#
# Example Usage:
#   ./parse_results.pl test_output.log
#
# Error Handling:
#   - Validates input file existence and readability
#   - Verifies failed and ignored test counts match found entries
#   - Reports parsing errors with detailed messages
#

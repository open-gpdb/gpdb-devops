# Script: destroy-cloudberry-demo-cluster.sh
# Description: Destroys and cleans up a demo Apache Cloudberry
# cluster.
#             Performs the following steps:
#             1. Sources required environment variables
#             2. Stops any running cluster processes
#             3. Removes cluster data directories and configuration
#             4. Cleans up any remaining cluster resources
#
# Required Environment Variables:
#   SRC_DIR - Root source directory
#
# Optional Environment Variables:
#   LOG_DIR - Directory for logs (defaults to ${SRC_DIR}/build-logs)
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Apache Cloudberry environment must be available
#   - User must have permissions to remove cluster directories
#   - No active connections to the cluster
#
# Usage:
#   Export required variables:
#     export SRC_DIR=/path/to/cloudberry/source
#   Then run:
#     ./destroy-cloudberry-demo-cluster.sh
#
# Exit Codes:
#   0 - Cluster destroyed successfully
#   1 - Environment setup/sourcing failed
#   2 - Cluster destruction failed
#
# Related Scripts:
#   - create-cloudberry-demo-cluster.sh: Creates a new demo cluster
#
# Notes:
#   - This script will forcefully terminate all cluster processes
#   - All cluster data will be permanently deleted
#   - Make sure to backup any important data before running

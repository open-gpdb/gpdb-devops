# Script: build-gpdb.sh
# Description: Builds Greenplum from source code and installs
# it.
#             Performs the following steps:
#             1. Builds main open-gpdb database components
#             2. Builds contrib modules
#             3. Installs both main and contrib components
#             Uses parallel compilation based on available CPU cores.
#
# Required Environment Variables:
#   SRC_DIR - Root source directory containing Greenplum
#   source code
#
# Optional Environment Variables:
#   BUILD_DESTINATION - Directory to store build data
#   LOG_DIR - Directory for logs (defaults to ${SRC_DIR}/build-logs)
#   NPROC   - Number of parallel jobs (defaults to all available cores)
#
# Usage:
#   Export required variables:
#     export SRC_DIR=/path/to/open-gpdb/source
#     export BUILD_DESTINATION=debian/build
#   Then run:
#     ./build-gpdb.sh
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - configure-gpdb.sh must be run first
#   - Required build dependencies must be installed
#   - /usr/local/cloudberry-db/lib must exist and be writable
#
# Exit Codes:
#   0 - Build and installation completed successfully
#   1 - Environment setup failed (missing SRC_DIR, LOG_DIR creation failed)
#   2 - Main component build failed
#   3 - Contrib build failed
#   4 - Installation failed

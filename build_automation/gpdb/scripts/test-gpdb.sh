# Script: test-cloudberry.sh
# Description: Executes Apache Cloudberry test suite using specified
#             make target.  Supports different test types through make
#             target configuration.  Sources Cloudberry environment
#             before running tests.
#
# Required Environment Variables:
#   MAKE_TARGET    - Make target to execute (e.g., installcheck-world)
#   MAKE_DIRECTORY - Directory where make command will be executed
#   MAKE_NAME      - Name of the make operation (for logging)
#
# Optional Environment Variables:
#   LOG_DIR - Directory for logs (defaults to build-logs)
#   PGOPTIONS - PostgreSQL server options
#
# Usage:
#   Export required variables:
#     export MAKE_TARGET=installcheck-world
#     export MAKE_DIRECTORY="/path/to/make/dir"
#     export MAKE_NAME="Install Check"
#   Then run:
#     ./test-cloudberry.sh
#
# Exit Codes:
#   0 - All tests passed successfully
#   1 - Environment setup failed (missing required variables, environment sourcing failed)
#   2 - Test execution failed (make command returned error)
